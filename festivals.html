         <p>India, a land of astounding diversity, is blessed with a rich cultural tapestry woven from a multitude of religions, languages, and traditions. Majority of Indians perceive religious diversity of the nation as an asset rather than a liability, highlighting a positive perspective on the varied religious landscape in the country (Religion in India: Tolerance and Segregation, Pew Research, 2021). Diversity of India treasures its most vibrant expression in the country’s countless festivals, each a unique thread adding to the magnificent fabric of Indian life.</p>
         <p>India embraces a diverse array of religions, encompassing Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, and numerous other faiths. Each religion brings its own set of beliefs, rituals, and practices, contributing to the cultural mosaic of the country. The Constitution of India guarantees the right to freedom of religion, fostering an environment where people of different faiths can coexist peacefully.</p>
         <br>
         <p> Many festivals in India are deeply rooted in religious and spiritual beliefs. Diwali, Festival of Light, holds immense importance in Hinduism, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. Navratri, a nine-night festival dedicated to the worship of the Goddess Durga, signifies the triumph of virtue over vice. Ganesh Chaturthi, a ten-day festival dedicated to Lord Ganesha, celebrated with the installation of Ganesha idols and subsequent immersion in water. Likewise, Muslims celebrate Eid to commemorate the end of Ramadan, the sacred month of fasting, while Christians across the country observe Christmas. During Christmas, churches are adorned beautifully, creating an atmosphere infused with joy and spirituality. The exchange of gifts is a customary tradition during this festive season. These celebrations not only serve as platforms for religious expression but also cultivate a sense of unity among diverse communitie</p>

             <p> Diwali, or Dipawali, is India's biggest and most important holiday of the year. The festival gets its name from the row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light outside their homes to symbolize the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness. This festival is as important to Hindus as the Christmas holiday is to Christians.</p>
             <P> It symbolises the spiritual victory of Dharma over Adharma, light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. Diwali is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin (according to the amanta tradition) and Kārtika—between around mid-September and mid-November.The celebrations generally last five or six days.</p>
             <p> Over the centuries, Diwali has become a national festival that's also enjoyed by non-Hindu communities. For instance, in Jainism, Diwali marks the nirvana, or spiritual awakening, of Lord Mahavira on October 15, 527 B.C.; in Sikhism, it honors the day that Guru Hargobind Ji, the Sixth Sikh Guru, was freed from imprisonment. Buddhists in India celebrate Diwali as well. </p>
             <ul>
                 <li>DAY ONE: People clean their homes and shop for gold or kitchen utensils to help bring good fortune.</li>
                 <li>DAY TWO: People decorate their homes with clay lamps and create design patterns called rangoli on the floor using colored powders or sand.</li>
                 <li>DAY THREE: On the main day of the festival, families gather together for Lakshmi puja, a prayer to Goddess Lakshmi, followed by mouth-watering feasts and firework festivities.</li>
                 <li>DAY FOUR: This is the first day of the new year, when friends and relatives visit with gifts and best wishes for the season.</li>
                 <li>DAY FIVE: Brothers visit their married sisters, who welcome them with love and a lavish meal.</li>

              <img src="photo-holi.webp" alt="a photo of holi festival" style= " width:300px; ">
              <p>Holi is a popular and significant Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love, and Spring.</p>
              <P>Every spring, people across India and around the world celebrate the Hindu festival Holi, throwing colored water and powders on one another in joyous celebration. On this one day—the full-moon day of the Hindu month of Phalguna—societal rankings such as caste, gender, age, and status are eschewed in the spirit of making merry together, and everyone is fair game to be doused with color.</P>
              <p>Holi's traditions vary throughout the country and have their roots in Indian mythology. In many places the festival is associated with the legend of Hiranyakashipu, a demon king in ancient India. Hiranyakashipu enlisted the help of his sister, Holika, to kill his son, Prahlada, a devoted worshipper of Vishnu. In an attempt to burn Prahlada, Holika sat with him on a pyre while wearing a cloak that protected her from the fire. But the cloak protected Prahlada instead, and Holika burned. Later that night Vishnu succeeded in killing Hiranyakashipu, and the episode was heralded as a triumph of good over evil. In many places in India, a large pyre is lit on the night before Holi to celebrate this occasion.</p>
             <P>In other places, the story of Krishna and Radha is central. The story goes that Krishna, a Hindu deity who is considered a manifestation of Vishnu, fell in love with the milkmaid Radha, but he was embarrassed that his skin was dark blue and hers fair. In order to rectify this, he playfully colored her face during a game with her and the other milkmaids. This is thought to be an origin of the colored water and powder throwing. The general merrymaking is also seen as characteristic of Krishna, who is known for his pranks and play.</P>

                <p>Vaisakhi, also known as Baisakhi, marks the first day of the month of Vaisakh and is traditionally celebrated annually on 13 April and sometimes 14 April. It is seen as a spring harvest celebration primarily in Punjab and Northern India. Whilst it is culturally significant as a festival of harvest, in many parts of India, Vaisakhi is also the date for the Indian Solar New Year.</p>
                <p>For Sikhs, in addition to its significance as the harvest festival,during which Sikhs hold kirtans, visit local gurdwaras, community fairs, hold nagar kirtan processions, raise the Nishan Sahib flag, and gather to socialize and share festive foods, Vaisakhi observes major events in the history of Sikhism and the Indian subcontinent that happened in the Punjab region</p>
                <p>Vaisakhi as a major Sikh festival marks the birth of the Khalsa order by Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru of Sikhism, on 13 April 1699. Later, Ranjit Singh was proclaimed as Maharaja of the Sikh Empire on 12 April 1801 (to coincide with Vaisakhi), creating a unified political state</p>
                <p>This holiday is observed by Sikhs and is known by various regional names in other parts of India. For many Hindu communities, the festival is an occasion to ritually bathe in sacred rivers such as Ganges, Jhelum, and Kaveri, visit temples, meet friends, take part in other festivities, and perform a mandatory daan (charity) especially of hand fans, water pitchers and seasonal fruits. Community fairs are held at Hindu pilgrimage sites. In many areas, processions of temple deities are taken out. The holiday also marks the worship and propitiation of various deities, such as Durga in Himachal Pradesh, Surya in Bihar, and Vishnu in southern India. Although Vaisakhi began as a grain harvest festival for Hindus and its observance predates the creation of Sikhism, it gained historical association with the Sikhs following the inauguration of the Khalsa.</p>
